### Getting To Ithaca

You can get to Ithaca via Car, Bus, or Plane.

#### Plane

There are several airports in the Ithaca area, including:

* [The Ithaca-Tompkins Regional Airport (ITH)](https://flyithaca.com/)
* [The Syracuse International Airport (SYR)](https://www.syrairport.org/)
* [The Elmira-Corning Reginal Airport (ELM)](http://www.flyelm.com/)
* [The Greater Binghampton Airport (BGM)](http://binghamtonairport.com/)

We recommend flying into the Ithaca airport if possible.
Any other airport will require you to find ground transportation to/from Ithaca from/to the airport.

It is often cheaper to fly into the Syracuse airport, which is a larger airport with more flights.
However, it is worth noting that it is approximately a 1.25 hour drive to/from Ithaca.

#### Bus

There are several companies that have busses into Ithaca, including:

* [Cornell Campus-to-Campus](https://fcs.cornell.edu/content/campus-campus-bus-service/) thrice-daily busses to/from New York City. Expensive, but very nice bus.
* [Ourbus](https://www.ourbus.com/routes/nyc-to-ithaca) cheaper, but still nice, busses to/from New York City.
* [Shortline](https://web.coachusa.com/shortline/index.asp?nt=0) cheaper still bus, destinations all over New York State.
